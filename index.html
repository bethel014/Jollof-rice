      <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil
          is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn
          golden brown.<br />
          Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and
          fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve
          about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and
          tomato paste for about 30 minutes.<br />
          Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not
          burn.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken
          stock. <br />Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme,
          all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for
          10 minute
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato
          stew.<br />At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is
          level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add
          the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for
          15-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew,
          cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid
          has completely dried up.<br />
          Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is
          ready!!üçõüçΩÔ∏è.
